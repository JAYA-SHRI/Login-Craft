<p class="para1">👋🏽 Hey, I'm Jayashri D — a curious and driven Computer Science student, currently in my second year, exploring the vast world of Full Stack Development. I'm passionate about building digital experiences that are not just functional but also meaningful and user-focused.</p>

<p class="para1">With a foundation in HTML, CSS, C, and Python, I've started translating my learning into hands-on practice. One of my first steps was creating a recipe website, and that experience sparked my enthusiasm to keep building, experimenting, and learning more every day.</p>



<h3><p class="font">🧠 Skills & Technologies</p></h3>

<p class="para1">C -> for sharpening logic and developing a deep problem-solving mindset
